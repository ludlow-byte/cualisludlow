<h1>LSC555 Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Review of Project Gutenberg's Website by Erin Ludlow</h2>

<h3>Context:</h3>

<p><u>Institutional Background</u> – Project Gutenberg (PG) is a tax-exempt, charitable organization that provides free digital copies of over 75,000 e-texts. PG has been providing free eBooks since 1971. The organization is committed to providing free access to as many eBooks (or other digital text materials) as possible to as many people as possible. </p>

<p><u>System Specifications</u> – The majority of the files available in on PG’s website are offered in plain text and HTML. Many eBooks are available in multiple formats; PG provides a <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/help/file_formats.html">list of all the file formats</a> utilized by the website. The emphasis on simple formats and character sets is deliberate and meant to provide easy-to-read files for both people and computers. The philosophy here is that simple formats are cheap to reproduce; easy to read, quote and search; use relatively little storage; easy to download regardless of internet speeds; and are future-proof.</p>

<p><u>Project Information</u> – Volunteers provide plain text files of books that are no longer under copyright restrictions in the United States, edit the submissions, and verify copyright statuses. All languages and subjects are welcome in PG’s collection. The collection is not meant to be authoritative, meaning that texts may not be perfect copies of their original, but corrections can be submitted later in the life of the file. This reduces the barriers for submission, ensuring that as many eBooks as possible are available for the average reader.<p>

<h3>Users:</h3> 

<p><u>Target User Description</u> – The average reader, i.e. those reading for leisure or pleasure, rather than the deep academic or profession study of texts are the primary target users for PG. PG has eBooks available for readers of all skills and abilities with access to a computer or other electronic device with the ability to read plain text and HTML. The site specifically highlights families accessing eBooks after watching movies or TV adaptations of novels. PG seems to be seeking an international reach, for both book readers and volunteers. To that end, PG offers books in more than 70 languages, although fewer than 20 languages have more than 50 books at the time of this reporting (February 2026). PG, like many charitable organizations, is also interested in attracting <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/help/volunteers_faq.html">volunteers</a>.  

<h3>Content:</h3>

<p><u>Website</u> – The Project Gutenberg website primarily consists of an eBook catalog and downloadable copies of books and other digital materials.
<ul>
<li>Online catalog – basic bibliographic information (author, title, dates associated with the original publishing, entering the PG database, and most recent updates); lists volunteers that submitted the text to PG; provides external links to publicly available information about the books (e.g. Wikipedia entry) and internal links to similar categories of books</li>
<li>Other machine-readable <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/">formats</a> after download (XML/RDF/CSV/MARC).</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p><u>Types of Resources:</u>
<ul>
<li>Links for volunteer participants, affiliated PG sites (mirrored or different countries), audio book versions of PG’s collections, and for donations to PG</li>
<li>Web 2.0 user update options are RSS, email, or social media</li>
<li>Downloading books and catalog for offline access</li>
<li>Multiple ways to search the online catalog</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Quick search on all page headers</li>
	<li>“Advanced” search using bibliographic or keyword inputs</li>
	<li>Full text search, uses search engines to find quoted sections of text through all of PG’s pages</li>
	<li>Category searchers and sections, including major categories (like a book store), user-created categories, and language-based categories</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p><u>Size of Collection</u> – 77,819 eBooks, as of February 21, 2026. While PG no longer appears to be accepting submissions of standalone music or image files, there are some entries that have associated image and/or audio files, e.g. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42911">Variations Chromatiques de Concert by Georges Bizet</a>.   
<p/>

<h3>Unique or Interesting Features That the System Supports:</h3>

<p>Providing free access to audio books versions of eBooks in PG’s collections seems like an interesting choice for the organization. This seems counter-intuitive for a website that has stopped adding music files to its collection. However, audio books are in line with PG's mission of providing eBooks to as many people as possible. Audio books make literature more accessible for people that experience difficulties reading text for many reasons or that simply prefer audio files.   
<ul>
<li>Around 50,000 titles are available across the three (3) platforms</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Project Gutenberg itself – audio files (.mp3 and .mid), when available, are listed along with the text files on books’ pages</li> 
	<li>LibriVox – audio files (.mp3) are available in smaller sections (e.g. by acts in a play), combined .zip files, torrent, iTunes, and RSS feed</li> 
	<li>The Project Gutenberg Open Audio Book Collection, a collaboration between PG, Microsoft and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology – files (.mp3) can be played directly from the website or accessed via Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or the Internet Archive</li>
	</ul>
<li>Recordings of varying quality and age</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Human-read and computer-generated voice recordings</li>
	<li>Recordings submitted from 2003 onward</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons of the System:</h3>

<p>User-resource-technology relationship</p> 
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Pros</th>
		<th>Cons</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <ul> <li>Readers users have several options to find books once they land on the PG homepage.</li> <li>Reading and downloading eBooks are relatively simple point-and-click options.</li> <li>Most of the files on any given book’s page have parenthetical notes indicating the device for which they’re meant to work.</li> <li>There are QR codes on the book pages to make sharing and switching between devices easy.</li> <li>Information on how many times each eBook has been downloaded is available in the entries so that readers can see the books popularity.</li> </ul> </td>
		<td> <ul> <li>The option to download batches of eBooks is lackluster. Users can download all of the collection or in smaller files arranged by date.</li> <li>The page that advises new users about which file type to choose for their devices, “Reading Options & Kindle” is buried in a drop-down menu. This page may deserve to have its own link on the menu ribbon.</li> </ul> </td>
	</tr>
</table> 		

<h3>Suggestions for Improvement:</h3>

<p><u>Substantial</u> – The options for batch downloads should be increased to include batches by author, by language, and by reader grade level. Adding those options may decrease visits to the PG site but would likely lead to an increase in the number eBooks downloaded and subsequently read by users.</p>

<p><u>Minor</u> – The organization is walking a fine line between keeping its focus and efforts on making simple eBooks available to the public and repelling younger or newer users with a site that looks outdated and neglected. Assuming a full-scale cosmetic update to the website is unlikely, then at least the “Background, History and Philosophy of Project Gutenberg” page should be updated. The page appears to have been untouched for five (5) years. Adding a new entry on the “Background” page in July 2026 would be appropriately timed for the 55th anniversary of PG.</p>
