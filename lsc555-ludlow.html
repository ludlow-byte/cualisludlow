		<h1>Atlantic Horseshoe Crabs</h1>
		<h2>Creepy, Cool, and Crucial</h2>
		<p>	Around 450 million years ago, Mother Nature said "good enough" and stopped making major changes to the Atlantic horseshoe crab 
			(<i>Limulus polyphemus</i>). While not conventionally pretty, the horseshoe crab has been thriving since then, becoming a key 
			component of coastal food webs, coastal economies, and medical research.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Creepy</h3>
		<p>	The underside of a horseshoe crab looks like something out of a nightmare. You'll notice the 10 legs first, all wriggling for 
			purchase. Then your eyes might skip down to that spike of a tail (or "telson"), before moving back up to see the  
			gills on its abdomen(?), surrounded by more spikes(!), and, finally, the pincers above the legs. The top side isn't much better. 
			The carapace is shaped like a horseshoe, or a letter "C" that's been filled in. It's naturally smooth, but can become covered 
			by other marine species, like barnacles or algae. 
		</p>
		<h3>Cool</h3>
		<p>	Horseshoe crabs are amazing creatures, despite their questionable beauty. 
			<ul>
				<li>At 450 million years old as a species, they are older than dinosaurs.</li>
				<li>They're more closely related to scorpions than crabs.</li>
				<li>They have nine (9) eyes!
				<li>They have <span style="color: blue"><b>BLUE</b></span> blood. It's based on copper, not the more common iron that 
				    makes red blood.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Crucial</h3>
		<p>	Horseshoe crabs are a critical part of our world. They are a "keystone" species, meaning that many other species depend on
			having access to healthy horseshoe crab populations. Many coastal animals rely on horseshoe crab eggs and the youngest crabs as
			a food source. The hard carapace of mature horseshoe crabs protects them from most other predators. Humans have used and 
			continue to use horseshoe crabs as fertilizer and as bait for more commercially valuable seafood. In addition to the body, humans
			also make use of that special blue blood. A distillate of horseshoe crab blood, limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), is used to test
			pharmaceutical products and medical devices for endotoxis and other bacteria. If you've had <a href="https://www.horseshoecrab.org/med/med.html"
			>a vaccine or a joint replacement since the 1970s</a>, chances are you need to thank a horseshoe crab for making it safe to use in your body.
			Because of their importance to both humans and animals, managing horseshoe crab fisheries has become a crucial need for states and 
			nations along the western shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Fishing quotas are set annually to ensure the population remains healthy
			and stable.
